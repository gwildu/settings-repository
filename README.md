# PhpStorm settings repository

These are my current PhpStorm settings. I use this repository to synchronize my
settings between different machines.

# Usage

To get it in your PhpStorm instance go to File -> Settings Repository and enter
this repositorie's url. Choose "Overwrite local" to get my settings for your
PhpStorm Instance. Or download the zip and load the settings locally by the
button on the ride side of the url field.
